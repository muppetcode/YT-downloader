# YT downloader

*Basic YouTube downloader made in Tkinter*

This is a small, lightweight program that downloads YouTube videos with URLs.

Some videos will require a higher or lower resolution (itag) to successfully download, try a higher/lower one when the download fails.

What is .pack_forget()? never heard of it.
Please keep in mind that some videos are illegal to download. I am not responsible of what you download with this.
